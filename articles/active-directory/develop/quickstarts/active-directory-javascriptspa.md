#Customer intent: As an app developer, I want to learn how to get access tokens using the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint so that my JavaScript app can sign in personal and work and school accounts.

# Quickstart: Sign in users and acquire an access token from a JavaScript application

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to use a code sample that demonstrates how a JavaScript single page application (SPA) can sign in personal accounts, work and school accounts, get an access token, and call the Microsoft Graph API.

> [!div renderon="docs"]
> ## Register your application and download your quickstart app
> You have two options to start your quickstart app:
> * [Express] [Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download the code sample](#option-1-register-and-auto-configure-your-app-and-then-download-your-code-sample)
> * [Manual] [Option 2: Register and manually configure your app and then download the code sample](#option-2-register-and-manually-configure-your-application-and-code-sample)
>
> ### Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download the code sample
>
> 1. Go to the [Azure portal - Application Registration](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/applicationsListBlade/quickStartType/JavascriptSpaQuickstartPage/sourceType/docs).
> 1. Enter a name for your application.
> 1. Select **Accounts in any Azure AD directory and personal Microsoft accounts** under Supported Microsoft accounts and click **Register**.
> 1. Follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application for you in one click.
>
> [!div renderon="docs"]
> ### Option 2: Register and manually configure your app and then download the code sample
> #### Step 1: Register your application
>
> 1. To register an application, go to the [Azure portal - Application Registration](https://aka.ms/registeredappsprod) and select **New registration**.
> 1. Enter a name for your application.
> 1. Select **Accounts in any Azure AD directory and personal Microsoft accounts** under Supported Microsoft accounts.
> 1. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and add `http://localhost:30662/`. Click **Register**.
> 1. Select **Authentication** menu, enable **ID tokens** and **Access tokens** under **Implicit Grant**, and then select **Save**.

> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal"]
> #### Step 1: Configure your application in Azure portal
> For the code sample for this quickstart to work, you need to add a redirect URI as `http://localhost:30662/` and enable **Implicit Grant**.
> > [!div renderon="portal" id="makechanges" class="nextstepaction"]
> > [Make these changes for me]()
>
> > [!div id="appconfigured" class="alert alert-info"]
> > ![Already configured](media/active-directory-javascriptspa/green-check.png) Your application is configured with these attributes

#### Step 2: Download the project

You can choose one of these options suitable to your development environment.
* [Download the core project files - for a web server, such as Node.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/core.zip)
* [Download the Visual Studio project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/VisualStudio.zip)

Extract the zip file of the project to a local directory such as C://spa.

#### Step 3: Configure your JavaScript app

> [!div renderon="docs"]
> Edit `msalconfig.js` and replace `Enter_the_Application_Id_here` with the Application ID of your application:

> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal"]
> Edit `msalconfig.js` and replace msalconfig with:

```javascript
var msalconfig = {
    clientID: "Enter_the_Application_Id_here",
    redirectUri: location.origin
};
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you use [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), the redirect URI will be set to to *http:/<span/>/localhost:30662/* as it is configured in the code sample's project. If you use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or any other web server, set the redirect URI to *http:/<span/>/localhost:30662/* and then configure the server to start listening on this port.
>

#### Step 4: Run the project

If using Visual Studio, press **F5** to run your project.

If using Node.js, on a command line you can run the following from the project's directory to start the server:
 ```batch
 npm install
 node server.js
 ```
In a browser window navigate to the `http://localhost:30662/` location and you see the **Call Microsoft Graph API** button to start sign-in.


## More Information

### *msal.js*

MSAL is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The quickstart's *index.html* contains a reference to the library:

```html
<script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/0.2.3/js/msal.min.js"></script>
````

Alternatively, if you have Node installed, you can download it through npm:

```batch
npm install msal
```

### MSAL initialization

The quickstart code also shows how to initialize the library:

```javascript
var userAgentApplication = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalconfig.clientID, null, loginCallback, {
    redirectUri: msalconfig.redirectUri
});
```

> |Where  |  |
> |---------|---------|
> |`ClientId`     |Application Id from the application registered in the Azure Portal|
> |`authority`    |It is the authority URL. Passing *null* sets the default authority to <i>https:<span/>//login.microsoftonline.com/common</i>. If using a specific tenant, set authority to <i>https:<span/>//login.microsoftonline.com/&lt;tenant name or ID&gt;</i>|
> |`loginCallBack`| Callback method called after the authentication redirects back to app|
> |`redirectUri`  |URL where users are redirected back after authentication with Azure AD|

### Sign in users

The following code snippet shows how to sign in users:

```javascript
userAgentApplication.loginRedirect(graphAPIScopes);
```

> |Where  |  |
> |---------|---------|
> | `graphAPIScopes`   | (Optional) Contains scopes being requested for user consent at login time (Ex: `[ "user.read" ]` for Microsoft Graph or `[ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" ]` for custom Web APIs). |

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you may want to use the `loginPopup` method to display a popup window to sign in the user.

### Requesting tokens

MSAL has three methods used to acquire tokens: `acquireTokenRedirect`, `acquireTokenPopup` and `acquireTokenSilent`:

#### Getting a user token silently

The `acquireTokenSilent` method handles token acquisitions and renewal without any user interaction. After the `loginRedirect` or `loginPopup` method is executed for the first time, `acquireTokenSilent` is the method commonly used to obtain tokens that are used to access protected resources for subsequent calls. Calls to request or renew tokens are made silently.

```javascript
// Try to acquire the token used to query Graph API silently first:
userAgentApplication.acquireTokenSilent(graphAPIScopes)
```

> |Where  |  |
> |---------|---------|
> | `graphAPIScopes`   | Contains scopes being requested to be returned in the access token for API (Ex: `[ "user.read" ]` for Microsoft Graph or `[ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" ]` for custom Web APIs). |

#### Getting a user token interactively

 There are situations where you need to force users to interact with Azure AD v2.0 endpoint. For example:
* Users may need to reenter their credentials because their password has expired
* Your application is requesting access to additional resource scopes that the user needs to consent to
* Two factor authentication is required

The usual recommended pattern for most applications is to call `acquireTokenSilent` first, then catch the exception and then call `acquireTokenRedirect` (or `acquireTokenPopup`) to start an interactive request.

Calling the `acquireTokenRedirect(scope)` results in redirecting users to the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint (or `acquireTokenPopup(scope)` results in a popup window) where users need to interact by either confirming their credentials, giving the consent to the required resource, or completing the two factor authentication.

```javascript
userAgentApplication.acquireTokenRedirect(graphAPIScopes);
```
