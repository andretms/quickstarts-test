#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to learn how my Windows desktop .NET application can get an access token and call an API that's protected by an Azure AD v2.0 endpoint.

# Quickstart: Acquire a token and call Microsoft Graph API from a Windows desktop app

In this quickstart, you'll learn a Windows desktop .NET (WPF) application can sign in personal, work and school accounts, get an access token, and call the Microsoft Graph API.

> ## Register your application and download your quickstart app
> You have two options to start your quickstart application:
> * [Express] [Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download your code sample](#option-1-register-and-auto-configure-your-app-and-then-download-your-code-sample)
> * [Manual] [Option 2: Register and manually configure your application and code sample](#option-2-register-and-manually-configure-your-application-and-code-sample)
>
> ### Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download your code sample
>
> 1. Go to the [Azure portal - Application Registration](https://portal.azure.com/signin/index/?Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/applicationsListBlade/quickStartType/WinDesktopQuickstartPage/sourceType/docs).
> 1. Enter a name for your application and click **Register**.
> 1. Follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application for you in one click.
>
> ### Option 2: Register and manually configure your application and code sample
>
> #### Step 1: Register your application
> 
> 1. To register an application for this code sample, go to the [Azure portal - Application Registration](https://aka.ms/registeredappsprod) and select **New registration**.
> 1. Enter a name for your application, add `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` in **Reply URL**, and click **Register**.

> [!div renderon="portal" class="sxs-lookup"]
> #### Step 1: Configure your application
> For the code sample for this quickstart to work, you need to add a reply URL as **urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob**.
> > [!div renderon="portal" id="makechanges" class="nextstepaction"]
> > [Make this change for me]()
>
> > [!div id="appconfigured" class="hidden"]
> > ![Already configured](media/active-directory-windesktop/green-check.png) Your application is configured with these attributes

#### Step 2: Download your Visual Studio project

[Download the Visual Studio 2017 project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2/archive/master.zip)

#### Step 3: Configure your Visual Studio project

 1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
 1. Edit **App.Xaml.cs** and replace the line starting with `private static string ClientId` with the Application ID from the application you just registered:

    ```csharp
    private static string ClientId = "Enter_the_Application_Id_here";
    ```

## More information

### MSAL.NET

MSAL ([Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client)) is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can install it by running the following command in Visual Studio's **Package Manager Console**:

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Identity.Client -Pre
```

### MSAL initialization

You can add the reference for MSAL by adding the following code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
```

Then, initialize MSAL using the following code:

```csharp
public static PublicClientApplication PublicClientApp = new PublicClientApplication(ClientId);
```

> |Where: ||
> |---------|---------|
> | `ClientId` | The Application ID from the application registered in *portal.microsoft.com* |

### Requesting tokens

MSAL has two methods used acquire tokens: `AcquireTokenAsync` and `AcquireTokenSilentAsync`.

#### Getting a user token interactively

Some situations require forcing users interact with Azure AD v2.0 endpoint through a popup window to either validate their credentials or to give consent. Some examples include:

- The first time users sign in to the application
- When users may need to reenter their credentials because the password has expired
- When your application is requesting access to a resource that the user needs to consent to
- When two factor authentication is required

```csharp
authResult = await App.PublicClientApp.AcquireTokenAsync(_scopes);
```

> |Where:||
> |---------|---------|
> | `_scopes` | Contains the scopes being requested (that is, `{ "user.read" }` for Microsoft Graph or `{ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" }` for custom Web APIs) |

#### Getting a user token silently

You don't want to require the user to validate their credentials every time they need to access a resource. Most of the time you want token acquisitions and renewal without any user interaction. You can use the `AcquireTokenSilentAsync` method to obtain tokens to access protected resources after the initial `AcquireTokenAsync` method:

```csharp
authResult = await App.PublicClientApp.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(_scopes, App.PublicClientApp.Users.FirstOrDefault());
```

> |Where: ||
> |---------|---------|
> | `_scopes` | Contains the scopes being requested (that is, `{ "user.read" }` for Microsoft Graph or `{ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" }` for custom Web APIs) |
 | `App.PublicClientApp.Users.FirstOrDefault()` | The first user in the cache (MSAL support multiple users in a single app) |
